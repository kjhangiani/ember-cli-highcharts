# Ember-cli-highcharts

Ember CLI addon to use highcharts as components in an ember app.  

### This addon is a fork of the excellent ember-highcharts addon by ahmadsoe

This addon is currently UNSTABLE and not intended for production use.  Forks the code from https://github.com/ahmadsoe/ember-highcharts and is intended to be a bit more ember-cli friendly.  I experienced issues with ember-highcharts when trying to do some more advanced chart manipulation, so this addon is a personal project (and my first ember-cli addon) to resolve these inconsistencies.

Again, this addon is UNSTABLE and is in a pre-release 0.0.1 phase.  Do not use it.

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember addon.
